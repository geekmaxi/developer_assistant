Large language models sometimes exhibit the phenomenon of "talking nonsense with a straight face" when generating text, which means fabricating facts,fake information, or giving answers that are inconsistent with facts. This phenomenon is known as the "hallucination" problem of large language models.
The "hallucination" problem of large language models can be misleading to developers, especially when developers seek help. If a large language model gives incorrect or false information, it may lead developers to take detours or make incorrect decisions.
By strengthening the integration of knowledge bases, improving the model's ability to identify factual information, and developing more effective hallucination detection and suppression technologies, we can effectively reduce the phenomenon of large language models "talking nonsense with a straight face" and improve the quality and reliability of their generated text.

## RAG Introduction

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an AI framework that combines information retrieval with large language models (LLM). It improves the accuracy and information content of text generated by LLMs by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge bases and providing it to the LLMs. Simply put, RAG is like equipping LLMs with an "external brain" that allows them to consult external resources at any time when answering questions or generating text, rather than relying solely on the knowledge in their own memory.

The core idea of RAG is "retrieve-augment-generate". First, it retrieves relevant information from an external knowledge base based on the user's question or input; then, it provides the retrieved information as context to the LLM; finally, the LLM uses this information and its own powerful language generation capabilities to generate high-quality text responses or outputs. The advantages of RAG are that it can improve the accuracy of text generated by LLMs, increase the amount of information, and enhance its adaptability. Therefore, it is widely used in question-answering systems, chatbots, text summarization, content creation, and other fields.

## Question-Answering Process

[Image of Question-Answering Process Flowchart](./assests/RAG问答数据流.png)
1.  **User Question**: User inputs a technical question through the frontend interface.
2.  **Getting History**: The backend system receives the user's question and retrieves the historical chat records of the user's session.
3.  **Information Compression**: Based on the user's question and history records, generates a new question that can understand the user's intention without relying on history records.
4.  **Multi-angle Question**: In order to improve the accuracy of retrieval, generates multiple new questions from different angles based on the original question.
5.  **Information Retrieval**: Uses multiple new questions from different angles to perform relevance retrieval on the knowledge base respectively.
6.  **Information Aggregation**: Aggregates questions, knowledge base retrieval results, and multi-angle questions.
6.  **Model Inference & Answer Generation**: Hands over the aggregated information to the large model for question answering.
7.  **Answer Return**: The system returns the generated answer to the frontend and displays it to the user.

## Environment Configuration

Before you start using Developer Assistant, you need to configure the development environment.

### Dependencies

*   **Conda**: Conda is recommended to manage Python virtual environments. You can download and install Miniconda or Anaconda from [Conda Official Website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
*   **Python**: Python 3.11 and above is recommended. Python will be automatically installed in the Conda environment.
*   **Docker**: If you need to locally deploy the Weaviate vector database, please ensure that Docker and Docker Compose are installed. You can download and install from [Docker Official Website](https://www.docker.com/).
*   **Node.js and npm**: If you need to perform frontend development, please ensure that Node.js and npm are installed. You can download and install from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **Databases**: This project uses SQLite (default) and MySQL as relational databases. If you need to use MySQL, please ensure that the MySQL database service is installed and running.

### Environment Variables

In order to ensure the normal operation of the project, you need to create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following environment variables according to the example of the `.env.example` file:

*   **Large Model API Key**: Configure the corresponding API key according to the large language model platform you use (such as OpenAI, Siliconflow, Bailian, etc.). For example, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `SILICONFLOW_API_KEY`, `BAILIAN_API_KEY`, etc. For specific environment variable names, please refer to the official documentation of each platform and model and the `.env.example` file.
*   **Weaviate Configuration**: If you use local Docker deployment of Weaviate, you need to configure Weaviate connection information, such as `WEAVIATE_HOST`, `WEAVIATE_PORT`, etc. If you use cloud Weaviate service, you need to configure the corresponding connection URL and API key.
*   **Database Configuration**: If you use MySQL database, you need to configure MySQL database connection information, such as `MYSQL_HOST`, `MYSQL_PORT`, `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_DATABASE`, etc. If you use the default SQLite database, you do not need to configure database connection information.

You need to copy the `.env.example` file in the project root directory and rename it to `.env`, and then modify the configuration items in the `.env` file according to your actual situation.

**Set `PYTHONPATH` Environment Variable**: In order for Python to correctly find the project code, you need to set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to the root directory of the project. For example, if your project root directory is `/path/to/development_assistant`, you need to set `PYTHONPATH=/path/to/development_assistant`.

*   **Linux/macOS**: You can add `export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/development_assistant` in the `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file, and then execute `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` to make the configuration take effect.
*   **Windows**: You can add the `PYTHONPATH` variable in "System Environment Variables" and set it to the project root directory.
